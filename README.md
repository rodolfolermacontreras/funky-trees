# funky-trees

# Problem:
Using the WI_Breast_Cancer csv file, create a new notebook to build a decision tree classifier that would be able to detect whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

# Abstract:
Rooney's client is a tech-manufacturing startup working on a number of automated detection devices for the medical and construction industries. Among the auto-detection devices is a reader that looks at possible carcinoma tissue samples to classify the sample as either benign or malignant. Rooney asks you for help in developing a better algorithm than the current classifier, perhaps a decision tree can help.

### Data exploration.
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Visual Exploration of the Target Variable: `class`**
- **Visual Exploration of the Other Variable.**


### Feature Selection.
- **Correlation**
- **Mutual Information**
- **Stepwise Model Selection**
- **LASSO**


### Evaluation/Selection of features.
- **Class imbalace**
- **Evaluation of options**


### Decision Tree Method.
- **Hyperparameter Settings Comparison**
    - Choosing the best hyperparameters for `entropy`.
    - Choosing the best hyperparameters for `gini`.
- **Comparison between Models (`entropy` & `gini`).**
    - Visualize Confusion Matrix.
        - Entropy Confusion Matrix
        - Gini Confusion Matrix
    - Visualize Decision Tree.    
- **Performance Comparison.**

### Summary/Conclusions.
